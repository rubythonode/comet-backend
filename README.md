# Installation [^](#installation-)
  ```js

    $ npm install // install dependencies
  ```

  Remember! You firstly need to configure and build your [FRONT-END](https://github.com/patrykcieszkowski/comet-frontend), in order to run the Comet Messanger; you'll need to specify API, Socket and CDN urls. After that, go ahead and run the app:

  ```js
    $ npm start
  ```

# Technologies Used [^](#technologies-)

  Comet Messanger is using Express framework, as it's based on my [easy-js](https://github.com/patrykcieszkowski/easy-js) starter-pack, it shares the same file structure. Although, there's more to it. Here's full list of techs/modules used:

  - Node.JS
  - Express
  - MongoDB / Mongoose
  - Redis
  - Socket.IO
  - JWTokens
  - EJS*

# Contributors [^](#contributors-)

  As this is Open Source project, EVERYONE is welcome to contribute! Even more, I'd love to see others helping out with this project; I am just mid-level, hobbyist developer. Any feedback would be welcome as well! I want your criticism!
