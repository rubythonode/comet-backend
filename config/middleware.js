        '*': 'adminAuth'
      }
    will run middleware 'adminAuth' for all requests pointed to 'AdminController'
    ------------

    However you can specify the exact function in the controller.
    For example:
      'AdminController': {
        'post_update': 'adminAuth'
      }

    will run middleware only if requested route points to 'AdminController' and 'post_update' function
    ------------

    You can also point middleware to all the controllers by using '*' selector.
    However, then you're not able to point to specific function by it's name.

    You can point to multiple middlewares with use of an array.
